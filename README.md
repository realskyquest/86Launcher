# 86-game-launcher

A game launcher for 86  

This branch was rewritten in go with fyne  

It has improved ui, notifications, bugs handling and finally the downloading gets a cache system which is useful when download fails  
The only possible bugs are weird ui issues and asset corruption

Currently the releases automation system is being worked on, after it is done it will be released for windows!
