# 86 Game Launcher

A launcher was made so that players can easily check what versions are downloadable. The launcher supports caching to reduce time to download and make it faster ( *Launcher is closed or crashed or WiFi was down, it will use the cache to get the current progress!* )

Go to releases to get the latest launcher, runs on windows 64-bit

**If you changed the version too many times, you will get rate limited!**

## Gallery

**Warning**: Depending on your os it will show either light mode or dark mode
